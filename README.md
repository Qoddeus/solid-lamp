PROJECT

This is a web app that helps manage inventory.
Made with Python and Flask, with the help of MySQL for data storing.

There are still a lot of functionalities to be implemented, such as:
- editing and deleting of data inside the app and not the database itself
- have each of the products, vendors, customers and users their own pages (route's parameter?)
- replace the hardcoded table and bar chart with the data in mysql

Installation
- download zip
- extract zip
- cmd -> cd to extracted folder -> create virtual environment
- run command -> py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
